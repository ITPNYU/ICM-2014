Notes: Week 2

Variation.
Your static pictures are using variables.
Difference between Descrete and Combinatorial System.
Why is it static because you used hard numbers instead of variables
Variables Take time to understand how to use.  Storage, Memorables.  
What do you want to vary.  X,Y,Z ,  difficulty, sadness, luck

What Can you express with variables that you could not express with a static or predestined system

Universal Machine,  Reflect human change IA  mousex

What if the the code became a variable and the machine could change that?  AI

Holodeck What are the variables of story.

Variables keep track of things of time. 

And because there is not life or time to the program.

Code Blocks, Paragraphs,  Non Linearity

Stay in the present moment.
The most things that make money in this world are about do better than chance at predicting or creating the future.
Declare the type of variable
Initialize variable
Vary the Variable
